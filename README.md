# Book adoption fun project

This project demonstrates a basic use of simple smart contract using Truffle, Ganache, Hardhat, web3.js. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract using truffle, and an example of a web3 application, which simply allow to borrow(adopt) books.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat test
truffle compile
truffle migrate
npm run dev
```

Run the app by:
npm install
npm run dev
